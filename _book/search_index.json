can go on to further refactorings, but baby steps...\nAn example can be something such as:\n#notes-table tr {\n    height: 25px   \n}\n\n\n/* Loads more CSS */\n\n#brand-settings-form-table th, #brand-settings-form-table td {\n    height: 25px;\n}\nAs you can see, there's no need for these to be in id's at all, the writers just didn't know (or think).\nTo combat this, I suggest the following which has served me well (though it can have 1 undesirable (but rare) effect)\nFind all single rule selectors\nFind all the selectors with the same single rule (In this case we're targeting height: 25px).\nIn my case I used a very naive vim search pattern.\n/height.*25px\nGroup rules together\nYou then want to start consolidating these rules into one mega-rule.\nIt looks terrible but it's a step in refactoring so relax.\n#notes-table tr,\n.table-box-style tr,\n#profile-table th, #brand-profile-table td,\n#brand-settings-form-table th, #brand-settings-form-table td,\n#new-event-bottom-right

class\nRename the selector to something semantic and remove the old bunch of selectors.\n.short {\n    height: 25px;\n}\nReplace all old usages\nAt this point, you've refactored your many selectors into one and so you're ready to startrefactoring the HTML and views that use it.\nIn some cases you don't want to remove all of the ids (javascript might be targeting it etc...).\nHowever, if it's just static HTML, then you should have no problems with the following:\nsed command goes here\nCaveats\nAs mentioned before, the caveat is that you're moving styles into one place in the sheet. \nThis means the selectors precedence has now changed and could potentially be overriding more or is\nbeing overridden itself.\nYou'll have to decide yourself if you want to take that risk (hint: I do).\n"}}}
